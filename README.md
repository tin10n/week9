ðŸ’° Welcome to Budget Tracker â€“ Track Your Spending ðŸ’°

â‹…ËšðŸ“ˆâ‹†ËšðŸ’¼ï½¡â‹†ðŸ’³âœ¨Ëšâ‹… Letâ€™s Take Control of Your Finances! â‹…ËšðŸ“ˆâ‹†ËšðŸ’¼ï½¡â‹†ðŸ’³âœ¨Ëšâ‹…

ðŸ“ˆðŸ’°ðŸ“ŠðŸ’³ This is my submission for the Guided Inquiry Week 9 assignment, featuring a clean and functional Budget Tracker app. It allows you to log income & expenses, see your total balance instantly, and store your data locally so nothing gets lost when you refresh. ðŸ’³ðŸ“ŠðŸ’°ðŸ“ˆ

** ** Whatâ€™s in this project? ** ** 
This repository contains the core files for the Budget Tracker, which can be used directly in your browser.

Here's an overview of the files and what they do:

Files in this repository:
- README.md â€“ Youâ€™re reading it! This file provides an introduction to the project and explains how everything works.

- index.html â€“ Contains all the HTML structure of the Budget Tracker, including the form for adding transactions and the summary display.

- style.css â€“ The styling for the Budget Tracker. Itâ€™s responsive, so it looks great on desktops, tablets, and phones.

- index.js â€“ The heart of the app! This JavaScript file contains all the logic for adding, deleting, and storing transactions, as well as calculating totals.

You can also access the budget tracker through the Vercel link.


** ** Key Takeaways ** **
Throughout this project, I strengthened my JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills while also practicing good coding structure with ES6 classes.

Key Concepts I Learned:
- Local Storage: Storing and retrieving data so it persists across sessions.

- Event Handling: Using addEventListener to handle form submissions and delete actions.

- Array Methods: Leveraging .filter(), .forEach(), and .sort() for data handling.

- Conditional Styling: Dynamically changing colors based on financial balance.

- Code Organization with Classes: Encapsulating functionality inside a class for better maintainability.

** ** How to Use: ** **
- Enter a transaction description, amount, and type (income or expense).
- Click Add Transaction to save it.
- View your balance, total income, and expenses update instantly.
- Delete any transaction with the Delete button.
- Refresh the page without losing your data thanks to localStorage.

** ** Whatâ€™s Next? ** **

This is just the beginning!
Future enhancements could include:
- Adding transaction categories (e.g., Food, Bills, Entertainment).
- Visual charts to display spending patterns.
- Search & filter functionality.
